#
# This file is mainly focus on classes of shape 
#
# To create a base class in Python that can only be used for 
# inheritance (and not instantiated directly), you can use an 
# abstract base class (ABC). Abstract base classes define a 
# common interface for subclasses but prevent direct 
# instantiation of the base class.
# Instantiation: If you try to instantiate BaseClass directly, 
# Python will raise a TypeError, because abstract classes cannot 
# be instantiated.
# Trying to create an instance of BaseClass will raise an error:
# base = BaseClass()  # This will raise TypeError: Can't 
# instantiate abstract class
